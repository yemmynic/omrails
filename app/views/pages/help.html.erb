	If you are in need of help, you can always try
	<a href="http://google.com">Google</a>,
	a common search engine (duh!)

Testing make blank spaces to layout different paragraphs. I'm sure there is a better way to do this.  I will learn that at some point!  The empty paragraphs above actually didn't add additional space, so that is NOT the right way to do that!  I'll learn sometime; not a priority right now!
